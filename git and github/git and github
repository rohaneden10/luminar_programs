git and github are web based applications .

git runs in your local machine

consider a project called college management.the different modules maybe student ,faculty,library etcc...
and each of them has their own functionality.

difficuilt to manage works of different users of this project.
so we are creating a centralized folder for everyone to access called repository having name as same as project.

accessing repository by local machines -clone
ie exact copy of the contents of repository availiable to developers ..or local machines\\

let developer 1 implement all functionality for student like login and other things..and placing his code into
remote repository is called-push but this change not reflected in developer 2 and developer 3.
to have this change only(not the excat copy again) reflect in their local systems -pull

let developer complete library module,he push library module into remote repository which
 will be availiable in the remote repository.for other to acces thi update only they should pull from repository.


single developer remote depository
we cannot push to remote repository directly from local storage
there is a area called staging area and a repository local repository
local storage ,staging area and local repository.we can only push filesfrom local repository to remote repository
so we move from local storage to staging area to local repository to push to remote repository
ie we clone from remote repository to local storage
git add-moves files from local storage to staging area
git commit-moves file from staging area to local repository
git push-moves from local repository to remote repository

 commands in gitbash

git init-initialize git

git status-listing untracked files

git add file_name.typeof file (or) git add -A   -move file to staging area
 git commit -m"first commit or initial commit"-we can give ay message

 git config --global user.email " msg   "
 git config --global user.name " msg  "
git remote add hub path of repository
git remote -v-check if added
git push hum master
